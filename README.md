TODOS:

- about page (about me)
- add feedback button on about
- move book/opensource to about, then use that space for feedbackfish

---

- the Open source github should link to the spinoza.io webpage

---

LATER: gather proofs

- book data: Part III
- book data: Part IV
- book data: Part V

- review everything using the spanish version here:
  https://archive.org/details/etica-de-spinoza/page/n1/mode/2up

- use {{ | }} notation to add corrections to Elwes version;

---

- script that merges all scholium and corollaries into the parent. Then parses all proofs to redirect 'sch' and 'cor' to the main parent as well. and write a validation script to ensure it worked...

---

- maybe an input for degrees of search, e.g., so that we only get 3 degrees of ancestry

---

---

- when a node is focused, all the edges that come OUT OF it should change color
- when a node is focused, all the edges that come INTO it should change color?

---

- run validation during build script

---

- get proof tree (complex)
- get consequences (complex)
- get connection (complex)
- highlight the path (or nodes?) that is common to all versions, when multiple are found
- get number of proof/consequence/connection trees
- text search that shows what entries include said concept

---

- give credit to all other tools, and gutenberg project

question: are there any dead-end propositions besides the last one in the book? is it something to note as important that some statements are made just to reach them, and nothing afterwards?

---

book tests:

- all members of proof exist as entry names
- sch and cor contain their parent as proof
- no repeated parents in proof list
