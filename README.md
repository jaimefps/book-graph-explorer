TODOS:

- about pages
- apply portrait-only alert to book modal (maybe to app as a whole).
- only a quick snackbar that alerts that the bookmark was updated
- add a a middle step between clicking a node and opening the book reader...?
- move book/opensource to about, then use that space for feedbackfish
- demo flow

---

- replace "What is this?" with "Demo"
- maybe just force the demo mode if first time visit tracked in localStorage
- the Open source github should link to the spinoza.io webpage

---

- "go back to graph" button.
- add feedback button on about
  or maybe add a "Contact" tab.

---

LATER: gather proofs

- book data: Part III
- book data: Part IV
- book data: Part V

- review everything using the spanish version here:
  https://archive.org/details/etica-de-spinoza/page/n1/mode/2up

- use {{ | }} notation to add corrections to Elwes version;

---

- script that merges all scholium and corollaries into the parent. Then parses all proofs to redirect 'sch' and 'cor' to the main parent as well. and write a validation script to ensure it worked...

---

- maybe an input for degrees of search, e.g., so that we only get 3 degrees of ancestry

---

- sentry io & error boundary around whole app
  (and report what query broke the app, likely based on the URL state)

---

- when a node is focused, all the edges that come OUT OF it should change color
- when a node is focused, all the edges that come INTO it should change color?

---

- run validation during build script

---

- get proof tree (complex)
- get consequences (complex)
- get connection (complex)
- highlight the path (or nodes?) that is common to all versions, when multiple are found
- get number of proof/consequence/connection trees
- text search that shows what entries include said concept

---

- give credit to all other tools, and gutenberg project

---

- "about" page itself has tabs to split stuff up in:
  - about me
  - exegesis
  - notation
  - credits
  - contact
  - ?: about other apps out there
  - ?: about further reading

---

question: are there any dead-end propositions besides the last one in the book? is it something to note as important that some statements are made just to reach them, and nothing afterwards?

---

book tests:

- all members of proof exist as entry names
- sch and cor contain their parent as proof
- no repeated parents in proof list
